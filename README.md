# Laravel 5.7 From Scratch

## [The Laravel Sell](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/1)

> Presumably, if you're watching this series, 
you've already made the decision to embrace all that Laravel has to offer. 
However, if you're still on the fence, 
give me just a moment to sell you on 
why I believe Laravel is the best framework choice in the PHP world.

## [Initial Setup Requirements](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/2)

> Like any modern PHP framework, 
you'll need to install a few prerequisites to prepare for Laravel. 
Don't worry: this is a one-time job. 
Stick with me, and we'll get through it quickly. 
We'll first install Composer, make it available system-wide, 
and then pull in the Laravel installer. 
This small tool will allow us to run a simple command (laravel new app) 
to instantly generate a fresh Laravel project.

## [Basic Routing](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/3)

> When learning a new framework, 
one of your first tasks is to determine how routing is handled. 
Or in other words, when I visit a particular URL in the browser, 
how does my framework route that URL to the necessary logic? 
Let's review the basics in this episode.

## [Blade Layout Files](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/4)

> When constructing your views, you're not limited to basic PHP. 
Instead, you can use Blade: Laravel's powerful templating engine. 
We'll talk about Blade more in the future, but for now, 
let's leverage it to create a layout file to reduce duplication and complexity.

```php
@yield('title', 'Laracasts')

@section('title', 'Contact Us')
```

## [Sending Data to Your Views](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/5)

> You'll often need to pass data to your views. 
Perhaps it's a collection from the database, 
or maybe a flash message to confirm a particular user action. 
Let's review how easy this is to do.

```php
<?php
view('welcome', ['foo' => 'bar']);
view('welcome')->with(['foo' => 'bar']);
view('welcome')->withFoo('bar');
```

```php
<?= $foo; ?>
{{ $foo }}
{!! $foo !!}
```

## [Controllers 101](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/6)

> So far, we've handled all route logic through a closure in our routes/web.php file. 
This is an excellent choice in some cases; 
however, I think you'll find that the majority of your projects will require a bit more structure. 
Let's learn how to migrate from route closures to dedicated controllers.

## [Databases and Migrations](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/7)

> Let's move on to the fun part: connecting to our database. 
This lesson will introduce a number of new concepts, so pay close attention. 
We'll first review environment files. 
This is where we can store important keys, passwords, and configuration settings. 
Next, we'll discuss Laravel migrations: what they are, and why you should use them.

### Note

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan migrate:rollback
php artisan migrate:fresh
php artisan help make:migration
php artisan make:migration create_projects_table
```

#### [Specified key was too long error](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/migrations#indexes)

```php
<?php
Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
```

## [Eloquent, Namespacing, and MVC](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/8)

> Now that we understand how to create a new database table using a migration class, 
let's now query that data with Eloquent. 
As part of this, we'll do a quick recap of basic namespacing and MVC workflow.

### Note

```bash
php artisan make:model Project
php artisan make:controller ProjectsController
```

```php
App\Project::all()->map->title;
```
