# Laravel 5.7 From Scratch

## [The Laravel Sell](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/1)

> Presumably, if you're watching this series, 
you've already made the decision to embrace all that Laravel has to offer. 
However, if you're still on the fence, 
give me just a moment to sell you on 
why I believe Laravel is the best framework choice in the PHP world.

## [Initial Setup Requirements](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/2)

> Like any modern PHP framework, 
you'll need to install a few prerequisites to prepare for Laravel. 
Don't worry: this is a one-time job. 
Stick with me, and we'll get through it quickly. 
We'll first install Composer, make it available system-wide, 
and then pull in the Laravel installer. 
This small tool will allow us to run a simple command (laravel new app) 
to instantly generate a fresh Laravel project.

## [Basic Routing](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/3)

> When learning a new framework, 
one of your first tasks is to determine how routing is handled. 
Or in other words, when I visit a particular URL in the browser, 
how does my framework route that URL to the necessary logic? 
Let's review the basics in this episode.
